                Baguio, officially called the City of Baguio, is a first-class and highly-urbanized city located in the province of Benguet in the Northern Luzon map. Baguio was formerly the provincial capital of Benguet, from 1901 to 1916, until it was converted into a chartered city. But the most common Baguio description is that it is one of the best cities to visit up North.

Now, Baguio is administratively separate from Benguet, although it remains as a tourist spot and the economic center for both the province and the entire Cordillera region. It is considered as the convergence zone of neighboring areas.

People from different provinces and countries visit Baguio like Tagaytay for its cold climate, history, culture, and native products. The Manile√±os, in particular, visit the place to escape the heat, noise, crowd, and the overall chaotic atmosphere in the metropolis. Indeed, the Baguio altitude is perfect for a highland retreat in the Grand Cordillera as well as a perfect spot for those Instagram worthy travel photos.</p>
