                Zamboanga City, city and port, western Mindanao, Philippines. It is a busy port strategically located on the southwestern tip of the Zamboanga Peninsula, on Basilan Strait and sheltered by Basilan island. The immediate coastal lowlands are narrow, with low, rugged hills located a short distance inland. Zamboangaâ€™s Spanish-style architecture, fine beaches, and mountainous backdrop combine with a climate that is cooler and less humid than that of Manila to make it a favourite tourist spot.</p>
